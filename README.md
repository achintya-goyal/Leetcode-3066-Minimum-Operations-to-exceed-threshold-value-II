# Leetcode-3066-Minimum-Operations-to-exceed-threshold-value-II


## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, the goal is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in `nums` at least `k`. In each operation, the two smallest elements are removed, combined using the formula `(x * 2) + y`, and pushed back into the list.

## Solution Explanation
This solution utilizes a **min-heap** to efficiently retrieve and process the smallest elements.

### Approach:
1. Convert the list `nums` into a **min-heap** using `heapq.heapify()`, which allows efficient extraction of the smallest elements.
2. Initialize a counter `cnt` to track the number of operations performed.
3. Use a `while` loop to process elements while there are at least two elements in the heap:
   - Extract the two smallest elements, `x` and `y`.
   - If the smallest element `x` is already greater than or equal to `k`, return `cnt`.
   - Otherwise, compute the new value `(x * 2) + y`, push it back into the heap, and increment the counter.
4. If the loop exits, return the total operations performed.

## Code Implementation
```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        cnt = 0
        s = nums
        heapq.heapify(s)
        while len(s) > 1:
            x = heapq.heappop(s)
            y = heapq.heappop(s)
            if x >= k:
                return cnt
            heapq.heappush(s, (x * 2) + y)
            cnt += 1
        return cnt
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N), where `N` is the length of `nums`. Each `heappop` and `heappush` operation takes O(log N), and we perform these operations at most `N` times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as operations are performed in place using the heap.

## Example Usage
```python
sol = Solution()
print(sol.minOperations([1, 10, 2, 9], 10))  # Output: 2
```
